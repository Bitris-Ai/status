| --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Availability Scan** | Every **1 min** | Immediate detection of downtime/degradation |
| **Latency Sampling**  | Every 2 mins    | Continuous measurement of response speeds   |
| **Historical Charts** | Daily           | Performance trend analysis                  |
| **Site Rebuild**      | Daily           | Publishes updated status visuals            |
| **Summary Updates**   | Daily           | Refreshes overall service insights          |
